socksByMythic is a Mythic-based alternative to Chisel for red-team use.  
It provides a fast reverse SOCKS5 proxy over WebSockets.  
You can write your own clients.

# Overview
Mythic includes code that packages SOCKS5 traffic into Mythicâ€™s message format.  
See the handleSocksConnections function in utils_proxy_traffic.go (around line 1197):  
https://github.com/its-a-feature/Mythic/blob/master/mythic-docker/src/rabbitmq/utils_proxy_traffic.go#L1197

On the client side, follow Poseidonâ€™s SOCKS code to parse and build Mythic-formatted messages:  
https://github.com/MythicAgents/poseidon/blob/master/Payload_Type/poseidon/poseidon/agent_code/socks/socks.go

This project only passes those Mythic-formatted messages between client and server.  
I use WebSockets for faster and more reliable egress.

The server is written in Go to reuse Mythicâ€™s proxy code directly.  
The client is written in Objective-C, but you can build your own client; a Go client will be added.

NOTE:  
This is a proof of concept. It should work, but it isnâ€™t production-ready.  
UDP isnâ€™t supported yet. A client can add SOCKS5 UDP ASSOCIATE later.

# Usage
### Server
```sh
cd server/
go run main.go
# start WebSockets server at 80
# start SOCKS5 proxy at 7000
```

### Client
```sh
# build with Xcode
./client ws://<ip>/ws
```

### Use
```sh
curl https://example.com/ -x socks5://127.0.0.1:7000
curl https://example.com/ -x socks5h://127.0.0.1:7000 # to resolve the hostname via the proxy
```

# Todo
- Add a client written in Golang
